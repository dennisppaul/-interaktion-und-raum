The class *Fictions, Speculations and Imaginaries* is concerened with exploring the ways in which artists and designers are crafting, visualizing, and (re-)interpreting fictions, speculations and imaginaries in order to shape, challenge and discuss predominant cultural, social, and technological narratives.

It is a joined class by Henrik Nieratschker and Prof Dennis P Paul. All participants are strongly advised to join both classes.
