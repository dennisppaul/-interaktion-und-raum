# Elektronik-Spass with Monsieur Fisgus and Mister Paul

in this class we will dive into the world of microcontrollers and sound. we will first discuss and explore different platforms and strategies for sound- and music-making and then delve into our own endeavors.

although it is not required it is helpful to have basic experience with arduino, processing, music and some healthy resilience to frustration or at least some strong interest in any of the before mentioned.

the class will be held as an approx 4-day block seminar after the lecturer period in september and is a co-teaching effort with felix fisgus and dennis p paul. the exact date will be discussed and announced in 2024-04.
