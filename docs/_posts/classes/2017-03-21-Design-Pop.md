# Design Pop



<http://digitalmedia-bremen.de/course/design-pop/>

*design pop* is a deliberately fabricated piece of work, that creates a wide public reaction.

in this class we will submit to the unrightfully discredited attempt to design for the sole purpose of creating public attention. using just the right triggers, codes, and vocabulary, we will create a series of design pop hits. have you ever wondered how to generate a design pop hit in ten easy steps?

if you are interested in participating please write an email to d.paul@hfk-bremen.de until 09.04.2016.
