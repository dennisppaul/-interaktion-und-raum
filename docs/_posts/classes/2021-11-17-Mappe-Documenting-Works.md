# Mappe: Documenting Works


in this class we will concern ourselves with the *portfolio* ( aka the *Mappe* ).

an artistic/design portfolio is usually comprised of a collection of documentations of works, thus this class will be concerned with the portfolio as much as it is with the documentation of individual works and projects.

we will start by looking at other artists and designers portfolios, discuss current methods and formats of portfolio presentations as well as methods and formats of how to present works + projects, only to then direct our attention to your portfolios and works + projects documentations.

apart from participating vividly in discussions in the class, you will also be asked to design and produce or improve 2â€“3 documentations of your own already exisiting works or projects, as well as reworking and reflecting on your portfolio.
