# Digital Artifactual Objections


> we are not living in a time of crisis but in a time of clarification.

the design of interactions and the artifacts they precede, produce, or require, have proven to successfully impose needs and desires upon their *targets*, however the same strategies can also be used to object and take a stand.

in this class we will look at and utilise interaction design as a *weapon* ( non-military and peaceful ), as a statement of opposition, as a way of saying NO! while at the same time allowing ourselves to install ( or better re-install ) the instrinsic, optimistic, and empowering notion of design to be able to end a crisis through our very own interventions.
