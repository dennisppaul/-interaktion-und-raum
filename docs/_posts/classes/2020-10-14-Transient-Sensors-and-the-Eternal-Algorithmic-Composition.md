# Transient Sensors and the Eternal Algorithmic Composition



## abstract

The premise of this class is straight forward: the participants will conceive and develope sound + music generating systems that use sensors to interact with rule sets to shape algorithmic compositions.

Apart from the actual compositions we will also collaboratively explore and develop infrastructures that facilitate generative, networked, embedded sound + music + composition making.

This class will be …

- … held in english language on request. 
- … held exclusively on MS Teams.
