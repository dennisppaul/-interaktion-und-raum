# These Designs Will Fix the World



## abstract

As a designer you had to be optimistic. You had to believe that what you do changes, tilts, or nudges things towards a more desirable version of the future; no matter how small or big, no matter how banal or deep, no matter how local or global. From the very start design practice has always had a built-in altruistic optimism that can only be described as naive, but at the same time allowed designers to self-confidently address topics reaching far beyond the *shaping* of things.

However, due to contemporary narratives, this optimism has come under scrutiny and has been replaced by a feeling of helplessness and disempowerment.

In this class we will embrace said *empowering naivity* in order to revive the notion that design actually *is* able to change and fix things. We will then observe the everyday, study situations, dissect interactions and identify or reveal patterns in order to develop and implement our own optimistic designs.

We might fail, we might vanish unheard, we might even look like fools, but we will not be guilty of not having tried … as designers.

this class is …

*   … limited to a maximum of 12 students.
*   … aimed at 1st semester master students ( in case of an *overbooking* 1st semesters will be preferred ).
*   … comprised of 2 modules and will be rewarded with a total of 12CP ( 2×6CPS ).
