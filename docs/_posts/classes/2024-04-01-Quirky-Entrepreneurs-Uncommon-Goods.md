# Quirky Entrepreneurs, Uncommon Goods

in this class, we aim to explore a design/artistic entrepreneurship by engaging in the empowering activity of devising, designing, AND producing artifacts, then selling them.

this class is as much about selling design and artworks as it is about making interventions in the everyday lives of REAL people.

This class is as much about trying to excite, persuade, and engage people with what we are doing as it is about the empathy required to excite, persuade, and engage people.

This class is as much about squeezing the last bit out of our workshops, material storages, and skill sets as it is about making somebody just happy.

This class is as much about being critical and challenging as it is about accepting the purchase as a form of verdict.

This class is as much about the quirky and the uncommon as it is about making an honest attempt and serious work.

This class is as much about challenging and tapping into our very own sense of _selbstwirksamkeit_ as it is about proving to ourselves that artists and designers have the power to make, transform, and potentially change things.

This class is as much about producing artifacts for an exhibition space as it is about populating a webshop.

This class is as much a series of individual endeavors as it is a collaborative effort to create a _character_, a _spirit_, and a webshop.
