# Infrastructure


- infrastructure thrives on potentials
- infrastructure is ever only realized through it s use
- infrastructure must lure into desiring possible futures
- infrastructure is empathic
- infrastructure thrives on altruism but is not limited to such notions
- infrastructure may be critical or disruptive
- infrastructure may connect to existing infrastructures
- infrastructure may hack existing infrastructures
- infrastructure may not reveal itself as an art/design work immediately or ever
- infrastructure is not confined to wikipedia’s description of *infrastructure*
- infrastructure lurks below and hovers above at the same time
- infrastructure is the "native material underneath a constructed pavement"

in this class we will work with the notion of *infrastructure* as artistic and design device.

if interested in participating in this project please send an email to d.paul@hfk-bremen.de or register via artist.

the first session takes place on 11.04.2019 in room 2_11.100.
