# Integrated Development Environments

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment Integrated Development Environments] or short IDEs are essentially advanced text editors made specifically for programming.

Very much depending on what you want to do [http://processing.org/ Processing] ( including spin-offs like [http://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino] and [http://mobile.processing.org/ Mobile Processing] ) is a very good tool for beginners. It is limited in features compared to others IDEs but that is the beauty of it. For more advanced users, interested in Java and C++ developement, [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] is very interesting. [http://netbeans.org/ Netbeans] is somewhat similar to Eclipse, in terms of features and supported programming languages ( ''On a personal note, Netbeans appears to be a bit more streamlined and focused than Eclipse; definitely my IDE of choice'', Dennis Paul ). For real hardcore developers [http://www.vim.org/ vim] is tool of choice ;)

''All of the IDEs mentioned above are open-source and available on at least Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.''

For iPhone and Mac OS X specific development the proprietary [http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/ Xcode] is pretty much the only choice.

If you are interested in [http://www.openframeworks.cc/ openFrameworks] you should consider Xcode when developing on Mac OS X or Visual Studio when developing on Windows.
