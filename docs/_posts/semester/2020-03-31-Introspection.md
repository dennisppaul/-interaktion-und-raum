# Introspection

how do you react to a crisis like the one we are currently facing as a designer/artist? do you stubbornly ignore it and try to go on with your daily routine focussing on the time *after the crisis*? or do you impulsively jump on the train and offer solutions, comments, or critical thoughts on the unprecedented situation? or do you try to roll with the situation especially when it mainly means that you have to slown down and wait? the latter is often referred to as a surprisingly great challenge but also as an opportunity to rethink and reflect. but what could this mean in an designer/artistic practice?

this class offers a space to facilitate an active or practical *introspection*. in order to structure the process the one and only task in this class will be to rework, reinterpret or rephrase an already exisiting ( and for that matter ) finished work.
