## abstract

in this skill-based class we will explore techniques for simulating ideas in software, material, and photography/video.

we will put a strong focus on *making*. let us understand *simulations* on their most immediate level, as modes of inquiry, ways to gain understanding about hitherto inaccessible systems ( in this case *inaccessible* because the *system* is not yet realized or realizable ).

as a prerequisite to participating in this class send an email to <d.paul@hfk-bremen.de> until **17.10.2017 20:00**. please also include in this email a short ( max 300 characters ) description of the work you want to simulate in the first assignment.

the first session is scheduled for 19.10.2017 10:00.
